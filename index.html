Had the pleasure of writing this new quarantine-inspired joint with talented RnB artist, John Concepcion, who lives in Winnipeg, Canada. We were on lockdown, but that didn't stop us from creating, shout out to iMessage, email, and Dropbox. Wrote, and recorded this in 2 days. Texting back and forth lyrics and melodies. First time working together, DEFINITELY not the last. This one's for all the lovers out there who can't quarantine with their S.O. lyrics Been stuck here alone Girl without you with me it don’t feel like home Think you should know I can’t wait till this is over This the type of love that you dont rush This the type of love that got me doing things all just because I still believe in us And yeah we got our differences Baby we can learn to adjust Oooooh No matter all the distance I don’t feel no difference To you When all of the fog has lifted I’ll be there in an instant Ooooh The storm will pass I promise that Ooooh Don’t matter if you’re close or far My home is where you are Babe I’m hanging on to every single word you say And i don’t care however long its gonna take Maybe we just needed the space And babe Promise what we have is kept safe For you i would reciprocate Everything you’re giving To make me Feel this way Oooooh No matter all the distance I don’t feel no difference To you When all of the fog has lifted I’ll be there in an instant Ooooh The storm will pass I promise that Ooooh Don’t matter if you’re close or far My home is where you are Home is where you are Home is in your heart Home is where you are, are, are I thought it would be like poetry That feeling of when eyes meet They said it would feel so easy Like how a bird takes to the trees They've written the songs and films and books Of how it would take just one timely look To dance and fall your way into love And that's how you'll know he's the one It feels like way back when I wish I had known it then There's no such thing as a soulmate 'Cause love is what you make of it I think I've got a taste of it I wish I had known all of this before I wish I had known, but at least Now I know I thought summer vacation would never end (never end) That feeling of sinking toes in the sand They said to enjoy it while you can But those words never seemed to land It feels like way back when I wish I had known it then That time is the quickest of thieves She won't ever be caught by nobody She'll run all the way to eternity I wish I had known all of this before I wish I had known, but at least Now I know It feels like way back when I wish I had known it then That soon we'll be gone with a final breath And there won't be time to hold onto regrets But I know there's something on the other end I wish I had known all of this before I wish I had known, but at least Now I know I wish I had known, but at least Now I know When you were here before Couldn't look you in the eye You're just like an angel Your skin makes me cry You float like a feather In a beautiful world I wish I was special You're so very special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so very special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here She's running out the door She's running out Run, run, run, run She's running out Run, run, run Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so very special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here?
